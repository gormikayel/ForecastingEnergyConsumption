# ForecastingEnergyConsumption

The final goal for this project was to develop a forecasting model that can be utilized by the electrical utilities to effectively and efficiently plan their energy generation operations. Such forecasts can be very useful for the utilities in planning their day to day operations, meeting energy demand, and avoiding any excess generation of energy.

This project highlights beautiful and informative visualizations and in depth analysis of hourly energy consumption modeled by XGBoost and FBprophet ensemble methods.
